## A twitter bot, striving to be modular and useful as possible.

So far dependencies are:
node.js and npm
twit
markov-strings
remove-punctuation
mongodb
monk

### Use

Wire up a function.  See if it works.  Add to it is you want.
Currently only function pulls last 200 tweets from a target user,
stripping all visually problematic formatting, then feeds into 
npm module markov-strings, sorts out the best scored string,
then returns.

### Some example output:

They also havent removed the Hyena of CueCats
discord is the test and he doesnt make her feel weird about an integer

@viss

TKIP and a one-liner that
If you would wager a windows dev env and have thunk it
